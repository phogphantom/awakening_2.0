# awakening_2.0
This is the second version of my game that I have called Awakening. I have changed many items. The two biggest changes were breaking the progrom into different files and making the text appear as if it was being typed out. I am really proud of this and would like to keep it growing. I would like to change the variables into a structure of some sort but I am not quite there yet.
